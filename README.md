# OpenAIAndroidRealtimeDemo
My First Android Kotlin Demo with OpenAI Real Time API, developer can now build AI agent quickly


I noticed that most demos of OpenAI’s real-time API are either Node.js or web-based, so I decided to release the first Android demo using Kotlin. Hope you enjoy it!

I’ll be creating more tutorials on AI application development in the future, so make sure to subscribe to stay updated!


For the Android app, we need to carefully deal with the following items:
1) the audio collecting and processing
2) the interaction with Openai API
3) Ensuring the AI agent’s audio isn’t captured while it’s speaking

Watch till the end for valuable insights and unique implementation techniques!
